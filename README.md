# casafails
This is a repository to collect CASA (as in [CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/)) issues in the context of interferometric data reductions with MeerKAT. The purpose is to inform colleagues about issues that have turned up during MeerKAT data reductions and potential solutions to the problem, as well as making the SARAO staff aware of potential conflicts of MeerKAT data products with the software.

**there is no software in this repository, only issues, and hopefully solutions **

To participate, please click on "Issues", "New Issue", and proceed. Or help someone with a solution by replying to an issue. Or file through the (solved) issues to find out if it is you or the software and to find a solution.
